# Simple Morse Code Translator In Python

Morse code is a method of transmitting text information as a series of on-off tones, lights, or clicks that can be directly understood by a skilled listener or observer without special equipment. It is named for Samuel F. B. Morse, an inventor of the telegraph.

### Prerequisites
- `Python 3`

## Algorithm

The algorithm is very simple. Every character in the English language is substituted by a series of ‘dots’ and ‘dashes’ or sometimes just singular ‘dot’ or ‘dash’ and vice versa.!
